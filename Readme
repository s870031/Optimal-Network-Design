Optimal Network Design Application
-----------------------------------

Author: Hsin-Hua Chen

Description:  This program use Floyd-Warshall's All-Pair Shortest Path 
Algorithm to design a network topology with given number of nodes (N), 
demand of  traffic (bij) and the cost of each link (aij). It outputs the 
topology ,capacity of each links, link density, estimated cost  which 
all satisfies overall optimal link cost.

Platform/compiler: MacOS, g++

Files:
generator.cpp - Functions for generating default value of demand of traffic
                and link cost.
generator.h - header file of generator.cpp
main.cpp - Main program for simulation
topology.dot - output file. shows the generated topology
sim - executable file for simulation
Makefile - Makefile for simulation

Compiling instructions:
Edit Makefile to point to the c++ compiler on the local machine.
To compile, place all files within a single directory and type "make".
To run, type "sim".

Run:
1. Run sim. The program will generate topology.dot
2. To open topology.dot, we can use to following ways:
   1. Tansfer to png file: 
		$ dot -T png -O topology.dot
   2. Rearrange topology to circle and transfer to png file: (Run 
      script rearrange.sh)
		$ ./rearrange.sh topology.dot
